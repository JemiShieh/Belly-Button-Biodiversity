# Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis Overview
Use JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Plotly to build interactive charts with a belly button diversity dataset.

Test subjects will be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons so that if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, they will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

Upon selection of a test subject ID number in a dropdown list, the ID demographic information will be displayed, the ID top 10 bacterial species will be displayed in a horizontal bar chart, the ID bacterial species per sample will be displayed in a bubble chart, and the ID belly button washing frequency will be displayed in a gauge chart.

1. Create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species when a test subject ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.
2. Create a bubble chart that will display the bacteria species per sample when a test subject ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.
3. Create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when a test subject ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. 
4. Customize the dashboard:
* Add an image to the jumbotron
* Add background color to the webpage
* Change the layout of the webpage
* Make the webpage mobile-responsive
